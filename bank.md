# Door Dash Project


Discover Loyalty Patterns with DoorDash!
The project focuses on analyzing loyal customer behavior for DoorDash. I was inspired by the show "Love is Blind" to compare customer loyalty to romantic relationships. They aimed to identify loyal customers and their spending patterns to enhance marketing strategies. The dataset is based on a modified case study from iFood, containing information on customer demographics and purchase behavior. Key findings include insights on customer spending habits, the significance of age in loyalty, and the surprising cost of advertising versus customer retention. Visuals include scatter plots that illustrate spending patterns and customer engagement with ads. The conclusion provides actionable insights into nurturing customer loyalty and targeting at-risk customers.

Why THIS Project?
I recently found myself glued to an episode of "Love is Blind," a show where contestants get engaged before even laying eyes on each other. I started thinking about relationships—not just romantic ones, but the ones we build with brands. Just like the contestants, customers can be in a “situationship” with companies like DoorDash, where they show minimal commitment. This sparked the idea for my project: analyzing DoorDash’s loyal customers to understand their behaviors and spending habits.

My curiosity about customer behaviors led me to embark on this project. Watching "Love is Blind" helped me connect the dots between romantic relationships and customer loyalty, making the project feel unique and engaging. I wanted to explore why some customers keep coming back, while others just pop in occasionally. This exploration of loyalty felt especially relevant as businesses compete for customer attention in today’s fast-paced environment.

Dataset Details:
The dataset I used comes from a modified iFood case study, containing 2,206 rows and 38 columns of data. This dataset covers various customer demographics, such as age, income, marital status, and their purchasing behavior. It was perfect for diving into customer loyalty as it provided a wealth of information to analyze trends and behaviors.

Analysis Process:
To analyze the data, I began with cleaning and transforming it to ensure accuracy. I created scatter plots to visualize spending habits and customer engagement with advertisements. One surprising discovery was how loyal customers responded to ads—those who accepted two ad campaigns demonstrated significantly higher spending. This finding made me realize that consistent engagement can lead to increased customer loyalty.

Visuals and Insights:



Loyal Formula
The first thing I calculated was how many times a customer accepted each campaign. I added an extra column and used the SUM to locate our loyal customers. This helped me identify how many ad campaigns each customer took in total. So now it's easy to filter and find more details about our loyal customers and not so loyal ones.


Loyal Customers of DoorDash Graphs
This is a compilation of the loyal customers of DoorDash. All the relevant information on loyal DoorDash customers and DoorDash products. Age, date of purchase, income, product purchased, platfom purchased from, and marital status.




Scatter Plot of Spending Habits
This scatter plot shows the spending habits of customers. You might notice a couple of lonely outliers—customers who spent very little. I wondered why they didn't splurge on extras like fries. Was it a bad menu day, or were they just in a rush? Understanding these anomalies is crucial for targeting the right customers.




Ad Engagement R^2 Analysi
The next visual represents the R^2 values for different advertising campaigns. It’s fascinating to see that those who accepted just two ads spent almost 10% more. This tells me that targeted marketing can yield favorable results, reinforcing the idea that keeping the conversation going with customers is essential.



Main Takeaways:
Nurturing Loyalty: Just as in relationships, a little attention goes a long way. Businesses need to care about their loyal customers, sending them reminders and personalized messages that make them feel valued. DoorDash could send a message like, “Hey, it’s dinner time! Let’s get you your favorite meal on us!” This strategy not only retains customers but also builds emotional connections.
Targeting At-Risk Customers: Those in a “situationship” with DoorDash need special attention. Offering personalized deals, like a free drink on their birthday, could shift their commitment level.

Generational Engagement: Understanding customer demographics is key. Catering strategies to different age groups—like using social media for younger customers and traditional marketing for older ones—could maximize engagement.

Evolving Marketing Strategies: Marketing approaches should change with trends. Using varied platforms to reach different customer segments will help maintain interest.

Conclusion and Personal Reflections:
Through this project, I learned that building customer loyalty requires ongoing care, much like nurturing any relationship. One challenge I faced was deciding which data to include in this project. Digging into the numbers revealed surprising insights that shaped my understanding of customer dynamics. This project has truly opened my eyes to the importance of customer relationships, and I hope it inspires others to focus on loyalty in their strategies.
